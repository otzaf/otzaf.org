      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
                We want to provide a suite of polished open-source
                software(-as-a-service) solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
                Our current plan: create open source software that can be downloaded and installed by <em>anyone</em>
                locally on their machines, with an option to use our hosted service for a small monthly-recurring cost &mdash;
                this helps us keep the lights on.

      <p>
                Most of our work is done in the public eye, and
                can be contributed to by anyone. Our roadmap is publicly available <a href=''>here</a>.
